  "description": "Knowing how to balance is an important life skill. It takes years of experience to learn. But no! You can practice on a balance board. You stand up and learn how to balance. When that becomes easy for you, you make it more difficult - roll a ball through a built-in labyrinth. And by adding dumbbells for weight, you turn board exercises into a full-fledged workout.",
